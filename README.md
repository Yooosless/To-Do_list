# To-Do_list
A basic nodejs application without any frontend.

My first node.js/express.js project.

I used nodemon inorder to make things easy for me.


folders- */Controller*- has all the functionality methods like delete, update, get.
         */db*- this is where we connect our project to the mongoDB. For database we used MongoDB, the link to that is hidden in the .env file.
         */model*- A folder to contain the schema. 
         */routes*- routes is where we set the specific urls. 
         */port*- 3000
In this project I covered GET,DELETE,PATCH,POST methods and tested them using postman.
